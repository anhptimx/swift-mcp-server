## Security Best Practices

When using Swift MCP Server:

### Network Security
- Use HTTPS when possible
- Implement proper authentication
- Validate all network inputs
- Use secure communication channels

### File System Security
- Validate file paths to prevent directory traversal
- Use appropriate file permissions
- Sanitize file inputs
- Avoid executing user-provided code

### Input Validation
- Validate all MCP protocol inputs
- Sanitize workspace paths
- Check file permissions before access
- Limit resource consumption

### Process Security
- Run with minimal required privileges
- Use process isolation when possible
- Monitor resource usage
- Implement proper logging

## Known Security Considerations

### File System Access
The server requires file system access to analyze Swift projects. Ensure:
- Run in a sandboxed environment when possible
- Limit workspace access to trusted directories
- Monitor file access patterns

### Network Operations
The server provides HTTP endpoints. Consider:
- Implement authentication for production use
- Use HTTPS in production environments
- Limit network exposure to trusted clients

### Resource Consumption
The server can consume significant resources during analysis:
- Monitor memory and CPU usage
- Implement resource limits
- Use appropriate timeouts
